# Service Recovery Paradox

## Definitions

"[W]hen consumers trust a service provider more after a failure than they did before the failure." —[All the Best Engineerinf Advice I Stole from Non-technical People](https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f)

"[A] situation in which a customer thinks more highly of a company after the company has corrected a problem with their service, compared to how they would regard the company if non-faulty service had been provided." —[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_recovery_paradox)

## Personal Application & Anecdotes

This explains why transparency with customers about failures to deliver (e.g. outages, bugs, missed deadlines, etc.) and transparent efforts to recover leads to stronger relationships with those customers.

One very obvious example of this was "lockmageddon" at Dwelo. One of our early customers experienced a massive failure of locks and we bent over backwards to fix the problem and make restitution. We were also transparent about why it happened and what we were going to do about it. As a result, our relationship with the customer emerged stronger after the incident.
