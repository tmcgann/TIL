# Trust

## Observability

> The reason why people have to be told to take time off when they have unlimited vacation time, or go home early if they’re finished at 2pm, or not to answer emails after midnight is because they have innate understanding that being observed working is more valuable than the results of their work. —[Marianne Bellotti

It seems as though this should depend on what the observer values. For example, some work place cultures disincentivize people from speaking up about failure while others incentivize it. Those that disincentivize it do so by punishing and even firing employees that make mistakes. Those that incentivize it seek understanding and look for ways to improve processes rather than change people. When an employer values observing failure they incentivize transparency and observability of failure.

Likewise, when an employer values results over visible workers (i.e. "butts in chairs"), the incentivize it by prioritizing the observability of results as opposed to the observability of people (seemingly) working.

## Service Recovery Paradox

> But trust also degrades naturally over time. Italian researchers Cristiano Castelfranchi and Rino Falcone have a model of trust in which it’s observability not success that is the key factor. Under their theory an entity that is silently successful can end up seen as less trustworthy than an entity that visibly fails. If we recover from failure quickly and efficiently, trust increases. Whereas when we succeed and no one notices we become more and more unknown and uncertain. This explains what is known as the _service recovery paradox_, **when consumers trust a service provider more after a failure than they did before the failure**. —[Marianne Bellotti

> [A] situation in which a customer thinks more highly of a company after the company has corrected a problem with their service, compared to how they would regard the company if non-faulty service had been provided." —[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_recovery_paradox)

This explains why transparency with customers about failures to deliver (e.g. outages, bugs, missed deadlines, etc.) and transparent efforts to recover leads to increased trust and stronger relationships with those customers.

One very obvious example of this was the "lockmageddon" incident at Dwelo. One of our early customers experienced a massive failure of battery powered smart locks. We bent over backwards to fix the problem and make restitution. We were also transparent about why it happened and what we were going to do about it. As a result, the customer began to trust us more after the incident.
